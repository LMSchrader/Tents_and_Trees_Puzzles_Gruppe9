Solves tents and trees puzzles as constraint satisfaction problems.
It uses forward checking as a pruning algorithm
and the following selection heuristics:

# Tree selection heuristics
- Random
- Most constrained variable
- Most constraining variable


# Tent selection heuristics
- Random
- Least constraining value
- Most constraining value
